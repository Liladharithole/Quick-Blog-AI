## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- MongoDB (local or cloud-hosted)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/liladharrrrr/Quick-Blog-AI.git
    cd Quick-Blog-AI
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following environment variables:

    ```
    PORT= any port number that you want to use like 4000, 5000, 6000, etc.
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
    IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_imagekit_private_key
    IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=your_imagekit_url_endpoint
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following environment variables:
    ```
    VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost: any port number that you use in backend like 4000, 5000, 6000, etc.
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run server
    ```

    The server will run on `http://localhost: any port number that you use in backend like 4000, 5000, 6000, etc.` (or the port specified in your `.env`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The client application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost: any port number that you use in frontend like 5173, 5174, 5175, etc.`.
